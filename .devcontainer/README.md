# .devcontainer

Two things in one image, and the split is deliberate — see the header comment in
`Containerfile`.

## What came from the trusted template

    template:  ghcr.io/infrashift/trusted-devcontainer-templates/java
    version:   v1.0.2

`devcontainer.json`'s `features` and the `FROM` line are that template,
digest-pinned and unmodified. Template 1.0.2 (2026-09-10) names OpenJDK,
Maven and Gradle itself, and every feature it pins depends on the one
`bootstrap` digest it pins. (The first java seed, on template 1.0.1, added
`maven` and `gradle` 1.0.0 by hand; those depended on a second bootstrap
digest, the Dev Container CLI installs a feature once per DIGEST, and the
second bootstrap died on the first one's venv. The republished line closed
that.) The seed does not fetch the
template at build time -- a template is applied, and what it produced is what
is committed here -- so the provenance is recorded above and regenerated with:

    devcontainer templates apply \
      --template-id ghcr.io/infrashift/trusted-devcontainer-templates/java

`scripts/test.sh` proves every reference is still digest-pinned.

## What this repository added, and why each one

| Addition | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `containerUser: user` (uid 1001, **gid 0**) | The template creates `dev` (1001:1001). The platform contract is `user` in group 0, assumed by the portal's `WORKSPACE_SSH_USER`, `sshd_config`, the jobspec's volume-init chown and `/home/user/workspace` in the portal README |
| `openssh-server` | Not in the trusted base. Its absence is a workspace that starts, reports its container healthy, and refuses every connection |
| `entrypoint.sh`, `config/sshd_config`, `config/ssh-login.sh` | The workspace runtime contract — the third is the `ForceCommand` the second names |
| `workspace-skel/` | Copied into an EMPTY host volume by the jobspec's prestart task |
| `/etc/profile.d/java.sh` | The `openjdk` feature installs under `~/.local/share/java` and declares `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH` with `/home/dev` written in; this renders them on `$HOME` for the SSH login shell. `mvn` and `gradle` are launchers in `~/.local/bin` (already on the PATH) that find their own homes and the JDK through `JAVA_HOME` |
| `postgresql` (the `psql` client) | This workspace has a companion database (`services/db`) and the verify reaches it with `psql` from inside |
## What the image carries, for the devpod verify

`make verify` in the devpod root asks the image which tools it declares
(check 6). This image's list:

    WORKSPACE_TOOLS=java,javac,mvn,gradle,jq,yq,git,git-lfs,syft,grype

## The three copies

`entrypoint.sh`, `config/sshd_config` and `config/ssh-login.sh` are copies of
`terraform/live/devpod-vscode/container/config/`. That is a
real cost of decision 1 — the repository carries the contract so that
envbuilder's output is directly runnable — and it means these three files can
drift from the platform's. **If the devpod root's copies change, these must
change with them.** `make lint` at the Terraform level (`lint-workspace-contract`)
compares every seed's and example's copy against the devpod root's byte for
byte, so the drift is caught in the collection -- but not in a repository
already on the forge, which carries its own copy.
